# DirectionCipher

Thanks to 3-axis accelarator adxl345, Arduino Nano and old CD-ROM, it was
possible to create magic cube that is opened after using some special direction
cipher that is combination of side placements. Code provides logic to operate
with adxl345 using SPI and guess in which direction our magic cube is heading
to.
